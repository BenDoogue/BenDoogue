## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a (2nd year) computer and cognitive science student at Te Herenga Waka (Victoria University of Wellington)

Although I really only started programming properly this year (2025) as I changed to comp from biology and am an absolute novice. I know a bit of Java and thats it.. for now

My goal is to learn to build user interactive projects and visual explorations so that I can freely create things that I enjoy.

Part of my degree is focused on AI and i'm interested in what the future of Human - AI interaction will look like. I think my dream career would probably be HCI and figuring out novel ways for humans and AI to communicate, past just voice and text.

email is b.d.doogue@gmail.com - but I dont expect to have anything worth looking at letalone contacting me about on here for another couple years.
